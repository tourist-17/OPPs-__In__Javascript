# OOPS IN JAVASCRIPT
## Basic Concepts
 - class is just wrapper over functions.
 - public and private may exist but protected does not exist.
 - dot operator is used to access memberFunction outside class.
 - Constructor name not same as class name it is defined using  "constuctor" keyword only.
 - we always use "this" keyword to access dataMember inside memberFunction
 ## this key word
 - Behaviour of "this" keyword is different than  in C++ or Java.
 - In JS, this keyword refernces to the calling site i.e from where the function or class is called.
